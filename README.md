My career spans investment banking, e-commerce, and fashion retail, giving me a unique perspective on leveraging data science for digital transformation and operational efficiency. I specialize in applying data science to drive profitable growth by using insights from consumer behavior and market dynamics.</h3></br>

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve built and scaled award-winning omnichannel footwear and apparel brands, combining entrepreneurial vision with a strong command of data science to drive business adaptability and efficiency. At Structures of Legacy, I am committed to helping brands harness advanced analytics and machine learning to navigate competitive, fast-paced markets.

Key areas of focus include:

Advanced Analytics: Leveraging Python, SQL, and Tableau to distill complex data into clear, actionable insights that foster strategic growth and operational efficiency.

Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics: With expertise in supervised learning methods like classification and regression, as well as unsupervised approaches like clustering, I develop models to optimize inventory management, enhance customer segmentation, and forecast trends. Techniques like Random Forests and K-Means Clustering allow us to segment customers and predict demand patterns, while regression models help refine pricing strategies for profitability.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): I apply NLP techniques to extract insights from unstructured data, such as customer reviews and social media feedback, which enables brands to better understand customer sentiment, enhance personalization, and align offerings with consumer expectations.

Data-Driven E-Commerce Strategies: From dynamic pricing and targeted promotions to real-time inventory optimization, I use data science to address critical e-commerce challenges, ensuring efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability.
